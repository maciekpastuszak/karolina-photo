# Karolina Pastuszak Photography

## Introduction
This is my first ever webpage, that I made from scratch. It is a portfolio website for a photographer starting her business activity.

The site development covered both **front-end** and **back-end**. Among others, this site introduces:

+ HTML5
+ CSS3 with Flexbox
+ JavaScript (with all modern syntax, ES6, ES2018, etc.)
+ Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, async/await, etc.
+ Bootstrap 5
and a bunch of other useful libraries, fonts etc.

To build this site from the back-end I used:
+ NodeJS
+ NPM
+ ExpressJS
+ REST
+ MongoDB
+ Mongoose
+ MongoDB Atlas
+ Cloudinary
and a whole bunch of npm packages, like Morgan, Passport, Multer and many more

The website has all REST functionalities, authentication, it serves cookies and sessions (mostly for the admin) and many, many more.
I hope you enjoy it!
